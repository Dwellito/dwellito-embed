## About

This snippet is used to load the dwellito widget into a responsive iframe within your website upon clicking any element (button, link, image) of your choosing.

## Setting Up The Embed

1. Add the following HTML script tag to the header section of your page

```sh
 <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Dwellito/dwellito-embed/embed.js" async></script>
```

2. To add the open widget behavior to the desired element, simply add the id dwellito to the element. The example below is used to add the open widget behavior to a button.

```sh
 <button id="dwellito">Need Financing?</button>
```

Note: The above is just an example. You should apply id="dwellito" to the element on your page that you want to trigger the widget.
